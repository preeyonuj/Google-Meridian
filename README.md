## Data

_Source_

At first, the dataset considered was called "DT MART: Market Mix Modeling" on Kaggle. But due to the lack of data (one year, aggregated monthly), it was decided to synthetically create the data. 

_Synthetic Data_

The data has five channels: TV, Video, SEM, Affiliates, and Radio. Each of the channels has impression and revenue data, and for TV, reach and frequency data have been added as well. TV and Video are the best channels with the highest ROIs. Discounts and Competitor's Sales are crafted to provide control variables for the model.
