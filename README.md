This project dives deep into Google's latest MMM, Meridian. For more basic information about what MMM is, refer to my article: *insert link here*


## Data

__Source__

At first, the dataset considered was called "DT MART: Market Mix Modeling" on Kaggle. But due to the lack of data (one year, aggregated monthly), it was decided to synthetically create the data. 

__Synthetic Data__

The data has five channels: TV, Video, SEM, Affiliates, and Radio. Each of the channels has impression and revenue data, and for TV, reach and frequency data have been added as well. TV and Video are the best channels with the highest ROIs. Discounts and Competitor's Sales are crafted to provide control variables for the model.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Generate the data with Synthetic MMM data notebook. The other notebook, Meridian National Sales, uses Google's own dataset found [here](https://github.com/google/meridian/blob/main/meridian/data/simulated_data/csv/national_media.csv)
3. Run the notebook! The generated report is at the end of the notebook
